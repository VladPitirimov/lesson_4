   <h1>Ukrainian Carpathians</h1>
   <div class="text" >
    <p>The Ukrainian Carpathians (Ukrainian: Українські Карпати) are a section of the Eastern Carpathians, within the borders of modern Ukraine. They are located in the southwestern corner of Western Ukraine, within administrative territories of four Ukrainian regions (oblasts), covering northeastern part of Zakarpattia Oblast, southwestern part of Lviv Oblast, southern half of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and western half of Chernivtsi Oblast.

     <h1>Chornohora</h1>
     <div class="block" >
        <p>
            Chornohora (literally: "Black Mountain"; Ukrainian: Чорногора, romanized: Chornohora) is the highest mountain range in Western Ukraine. It is within the Polonynian Beskids, a subgroup of the mountain group of Eastern Beskids, which in turn is part of the Outer Eastern Carpathians.
            The range is located on the administrative border between Ivano-Frankivsk and Zakarpattia oblasts. It is adjacent to the Gorgany range. The highest peak of Chornohora is Hoverla (2,061 m) with other high peaks including Pip Ivan (2,022 m) and Petros (2,020 m). The mountains are made of flysch rock.
            The major part of the range forms the watershed between the Prut and Tysa River. The lower parts of Chornohora are inhabited by Hutsuls, whose primary occupation is herding. Major tourist centres of Chornohora are Bystrets, Dzembronia, Rakhiv, Verkhovyna, Vorokhta and Yasinia.
            In 1968 on the southern macroslope was established the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve, and in 1980 on the northern macroslope the Carpathian National Nature Park.

        The Svydovets (Ukrainian Свидівець; Polish Świdowiec; Czech and Slovak Svidovec; German Swydiwez) is a mountain range in western Ukraine, one of the ranges of Eastern Beskids, itself belonging to the Outer Eastern Carpathians.[1] It is a biodiversity hotspot in the Ukrainian Carpathians. The territories of the Svydovets mountain range belong to the state. The highest peak of the range is Blysnyzi mountain (1883 m). The Black Tisza, the source of Tisza, is one of the more fullflowing rivers of the region, it flows out from the Svydovets.

        The Svydovets is home to 42 plant species and 51 animal species that are listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine as endangered. The red-listed plant species include the Rhodiola rosea, the Carpathian saxifrage, the fir clubmoss (Huperzia selago), and the stiff clubmoss (Lycopodium annotinum). The endangered animal species include the European brown bear, the Eurasian lynx, the black grouse, and the Eurasian eagle-owl. There are also species endemic to the region like the Carpathian newt (Lissotriton montandoni). All of the ten woodpecker species of European deciduous forests can be found in the Svydovets. There are three lakes, located on the Svydovets range: the high-mountain lake Apshynets (also referred to as Troiaska), Vorozheska and the glacial high-mountain pond Heryshaska (or Dohiaska), with little algae, the most common of the fauna are microscopic crustaceans.
        Two mountain ranges in the Ukrainian Carpathians, Borzhava and Svydovets, are protected under the Emerald Network of environmentally important conservation areas established by the Council of Europe. The Natura 2000 network apply there
